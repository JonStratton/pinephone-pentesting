# pinephone-pentesting
A small collection of security hacking tools for the Pinephone. Some or all use of these tools may be illegal. Use at your own risk. 
Some of these scripts use "tk" for the GUI, so:

	sudo apt-get install python3-tk

## deauth.py
A simple Python3 + TK Deather. Basically a wrapper around a subset of aircrack-ng. To install:

	./deauth.py install

You may need to log out and on again for commands that need “sudo” access to work.
